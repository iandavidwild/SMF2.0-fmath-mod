This mod integrates the fMath editor into an SMF forum (see below for more details on the fMath editor). It adds a new 'fMath' button to the SMF text editor which, when pressed, will display the fMath editor in a pop-up child window. Use the fMath WYSIWYG math notation editor to write LaTeX code and press the Insert button to add the code directly into the SMF text editor.

Tested on version 2.0.15

[b]Installation[/b]

This mod is only a wrapper for the fMath editor, which contains a large number of files (fonts, symbols, etc) and so is distributed separately. After installing this mod you will need to download the fMath editor files and copy them over to your server.
