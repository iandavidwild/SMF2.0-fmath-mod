# Math Notation Editor mod for Simple Machines Forum

This mod integrates the fMath editor into an SMF forum (see below for more details on the fMath editor). It adds a new 'fMath' button to the SMF text editor which, when pressed, will display the fMath editor in a pop-up child window. Use the fMath WYSIWYG math notation editor to write LaTeX code and press the Insert button to add the code directly into the SMF text editor.

Tested on version 2.0.15

## Installing

This mod contains a large number of files (alphabets, symbols, etc) and so may take a long while to install. Modify your php.ini file to increase the 'max_execution_time' (remembering to set it back again after installation).

## Styling

Once installed, a style sheet (called 'popup.css') for the pop-up window is located in the /fMath folder. Only basic styling is provided and it is expected that you would style the editor for your own site.

## fMath Acknowledgements
